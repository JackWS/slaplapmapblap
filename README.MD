This is a mapping project that I did in late 2011.

Map Data is retrieved via JSON. (You have to figure that one out.)

All pin behaviors are data driven.  Options are:

Basic Pin
Basic Pin with callout to detail view.
Basic Pin with callout to phone.
Advanced Pin with overlay and description.
Advanced Pin with overlay, bitmap and description.
Advanced Pin with overlay, bitmap and description as well as call detail view or phone.

Other features:
Images are cached to reduce download times.
Data is retrieved on a schedule or every time.
And other stuff to delight your users and your mind.
Itemized overlays were done with BalloonItemizedOverlay by Jeff Gilfelt


What is not done (and won't be unless someone forks this...
Clustering algorighm using something like a K-Means or similar algorithm.
